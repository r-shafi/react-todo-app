# React Todo App

This TODO APP is built with React.

## My Build Process

1. Created all the basic parts of a todo app in the `App.tsx` file.
2. No style added, just the markup.
3. Added no functionality to the app.
4. After setting up the basic layout, I started taking out chunks of the code with related functionality and put them in their own component files.
5. I started adding the functionality to the components but didn't connect them to each-other.
6. Enforced Type Safety.
7. Added the ability to add new todos.
8. Used Context and custom hook to make the todos available to all components, plus I can update the todos from any component within the context provider.
9. I started adding functionality on todo items.
10. I started updating application state on user interaction.
11. Implemented data persistence using localStorage.
